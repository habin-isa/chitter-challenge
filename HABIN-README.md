Chitter Challenge
=================

This is the week four weekend challenge @ Makers. This weekend I am making a Twitter clone, nicely named 'Chitter', users will post messages, each is called a 'Peep'. The challenge will follow TDD and OOD principles, and put to practice this week's learning of databases within a full stack web app.

Instructions:
=================
- rvm install ruby-2.5.0
- bundle init
